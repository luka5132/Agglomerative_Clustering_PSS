# Overview of Repo

## General supervision
This repo hosts the code as well as the paper for my (Lukas Busch) master these at the University of Amsterdam.
I researched the use of agglomerative clustering for page stream segmentation (PSS) on Dutch WOO (WOB) requests. These are long streams of concatenated documents, that we through PSS try to split up into the original documents. An important first step to make these streams more readable and to make the Open Government act funcion better. 

## Acknowledgements
In this researched I have been supervised by [Maarten Marx](https://www.uva.nl/profiel/m/a/m.j.marx/m.j.marx.html).

We used agglomerative clustering instead of the standard state-of-the-art approach, which is first page classification. To compare our results and to obtain finetuned deep learned vector representations we use the CNN models created by [Wiedemann et al.](https://github.com/uhh-lt/pss-lrev)
